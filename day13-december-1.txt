[12/1/16, 8:43:30 AM] Kate: Billy and the other scouts had been hiking on the mountain all morning when they realized they were lost. They looked each direction. They did not see the camp. They did not see the river. 

The scouts were tired because they had been hiking for four hours. They were worried because they were lost. They sat down under a tree. 

But Billy was not worried. Billy had been hiking these mountains with his dad his whole life. Billy's dad had been teaching him how to use a compass for three years. Billy climbed a tree and saw the river. He knew the camp was north of the river. Billy looked at his compass. He guided the scouts back to the camp.
